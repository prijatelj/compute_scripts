## Scratch Spaces
The CRC provides scratch365 space (500GB) and scratch spaces for CVRL use.

To check the current use of scratch365:
`pan_df -H /scratch365/netid`

For convenience, consider symlinking the (cvrl) scratch spaces you use to your CRC home directory.

### CVRL Scratch Spaces
CVRL has scratch spaces for use by the lab members.
To use a scratch space you must:

1. ensure it is free to be used or that you are able to share it with another.
2. sign up for the space at . . .
3. add your name to which space(s) you signed up for in the google sheet shared in the CVRL slack

It is recommended that you:
1. make a directory in the scratch space with your ND id and work within it.
2. add a README.md to your directory detailing what you are currently using the space for.
    - which project and funders
    - whose the PIs
    - purpose: data storge,

This helps others and future you to know what that space is currently used for to assess if it is time to back up this space elsewhere and clear it, or to keep it as is.
