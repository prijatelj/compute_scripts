How to continue to run SHADHO (or any process) on condorfe when logged out of ssh session:
```
#ssh login
pagsh
# request a token to allow your processes to live for as long as 30 days.
kinit
# fill in your user password
aklog
screen -S screen_session_name
# run your process in that screen session, then detach with the following hotkey sequence of two:
#Ctrl-A D
#logout of pagsh
#logout of ssh
```

You can return to your shell created by pagsh just by retyping it in. And then you can also return to screen using `screen -r screen_session_name`. You can check the existing jobs in screen by typing in `jobs` and return to a specific job with its number. so first job is `$1` when in screen.

Note that you can create a new session with a specified name using `screen -S session_name`. Or if renaming a session while in screen `Ctrl+A : current_session_name new_session_name`. To attach a named session: `screen -r session_name`

In case you don't know this already: If you mess up like I did and need to nuke all of your shadho processes I recommend the following command replacing user with your username:

```
ps -U username | egrep -v "ssh|screen" | cut -b11-15 | xargs -t kill
```
This will kills all processes of the specific user except for ssh and screen, change that as necessary. [EDIT] it did when I tried it for the first few times, now it appears to not work. uncertain why. Eitherway, `killall -u username` work too, you just have to possibly run it multiple times because it may kill itself before killing the shadho workers.
