@everyone, in svm_task change it to:
```
module add python/3.6.4
mkdir .joblib
export JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER=".joblib"
python3 svm.py
rm -rf .joblib
```
this will prevent an Error with Device Storage Full, in case of repeated testing.

Just a reminder in case you have a script not updated like i did:
remember to add shadho_wq_factory calls add: ` --tasks-per-worker=1` to limit each worker to one task only. This matches SHADHO's orignal experimentation.
