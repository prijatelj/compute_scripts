# Using Condor via Workqueue
The following contents were originally provided by Jeff Kinnison to aide me (Derek Prijatelj) in running my jobs enmasse on Condor machines.

The code is to be copied and used with modifications to whatever the task I want to run on Condor is.

## Notes:

TODO writing notes from meeting with Jeff on how to use Condor and work queue and what to watch out for...
