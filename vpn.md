#Notre Dame VPN

specifically on Linux:

can install AnyConnect on Linux from source
Jeff runs Solus 4.0, on Network settings page it let him set up a VPN connection to ND that can be turned on and off.
Just had to use the Cisco AnyConnect protocal and give it vpnaccess.nd.edu/mfa as the url.

Jeff believes he is using OpenVPN and that it automatically had the AnyConnect protocol installed.

This needs revisiting and experimenting with setting up on ArchLinux.
